# VaultSeed
Allows you to set seed of the vault made with vault crystal<br>
Use `/the_vault crystal setSeed <seed>` to set the seed, if <seed> is empty, vault will have random seed.<br>
Keep in mind that you will need to set the same seed and lvl (with `/the_vault crystal setLevel <lvl>`) to generate the same vault.<br><br>
Some values will generate different seeds (for example negative numbers), but any seed visible on the vault end screen should generate the same seed when you enter it into the setSeed command.
