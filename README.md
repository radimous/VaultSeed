# VaultSeed
Allows you to set seed of the vault made with vault crystal<br>
Use `/the_vault crystal setSeed <seed>` to set the seed, if `<seed>` is empty, the vault will have random seed.<br>
Keep in mind that you will need to set the same seed and lvl (with `/the_vault crystal setLevel <lvl>`) to generate the same vault.<br>
This mod also adds button to the vault end screen that allows you to copy the vault seed (can be disabled in config).
